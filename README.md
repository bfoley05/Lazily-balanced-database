Project Title: MP5 LB-BSTs

Overview:
MP5's goal is to simulate a rudimentary database to simulate students and faculty at a school. By using a self-rotating BST we are able to simulate this with fast lookup and insert delete in good cases. Using user input we add and delete from the databases and are able to change certain aspects of students and faculty such as advisors or advisees.
